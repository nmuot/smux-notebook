abstract={This paper describes the implementation of the thin-strut
                  formalism in the 3-D EMP time-domain
                  finite-difference code THREDE. The thin-strut
                  formalism permits inclusion of arbitrary fine wires
                  in THREDE without imposing any corresponding demand
                  to reduce the cell size to the wire size. The
                  keystone of this technique is the so-called in-cell
                  inductance-the inductance per unit length a thin
                  wire would have with respect to an enclosing
                  conductor half a cell removed. THREDE results using
                  this formalism are compared with analytic EMP
                  solutions for a linear dipole antenna and a loop
                  antenna. Errors are around 10 percent for the loop
                  and 7 percent for the dipole. The 10-percent loop
                  error could probably be improved; the 7-percent
                  dipole error seems to be fundamental to the basic
                  THREDE approximations.},

abstract={The inclusion of lumped elements, both linear and nonlinear,
                  into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
                  algorithm has been recently made possible by the
                  introduction of the lumped element FDTD method. Such
                  a method, however, cannot efficiently and accurately
                  account for two-terminal networks made of several
                  lumped elements, arbitrarily connected
                  together. This limitation can be removed as proposed
                  in this paper by describing the network in terms of
                  its impedance in the Laplace domain and by using
                  appropriate digital signal-processing methodologies
                  to fit the resulting description to Yee's

                  the waves defined by [Equation], [Equation] where
                  Vi, and Zi, are the voltage at and the current
                  flowing into the ith port of a junction and Zi, is
                  the impedance of the circuit connected to the ith
                  port. The square of the magnitude of these waves is
                  directly related to the exchangeable power of a
                  source and the reflected power. For this reason, in
                  this paper, they are called the power waves. For
                  certain applications where the power relations are
                  of main concern, the power waves are more suitable
                  quantities than the conventional traveling
                  waves. The lossless and reciprocal conditions as
                  well as the frequency characteristics of the
                  scattering matrix are presented. Then, the formula
                  is given for a new scattering matrix when the Zi's

abstract={With appropriate modifications, the finite-difference
                  time-domain (FDTD) method can be used to analyze
                  propagation through linear isotropic dispersive
                  media. Although materials characterized by the Debye
                  permittivity model can be analyzed accurately and
                  efficiently using well established methods, the
                  treatment of other types of frequency dependence is
                  more difficult. This paper proposes the use of a
                  weighted sum of Debye functions to approximate more
                  general complex permittivity functions. A
                  combination of the particle swarm optimization
                  method and linear least squares optimization is used
                  to find the relaxation frequencies and weights in
                  the expansion, which can then be accommodated in the
                  FDTD method using one of the established
                  methods. Two key advantages of the proposed approach
                  are that the relaxation frequencies are bandlimited
                  and the weights are always positive. These two
                  characteristics help to maintain the accuracy and
                  stability of the FDTD solution. It is also shown
                  that the correlation between the imaginary parts of
                  two Debye functions is the same as that between the
                  real parts.},

                  frequencies is guided by the actual frequency range
                  of interest, there is a greater chance that a
                  minimum number of Debye functions will be required
                  in the expansion. This leads to a more efficient
                  FDTD solution, since computer memory requirements

                  for Maxwell's equations. The combination of the von
                  Neumann method with the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is
                  proposed as an algebraic procedure for obtaining
                  analytical closed-form stability expressions. This
                  technique is applied to the problem of determining
                  the stability conditions of an extension of the FDTD
                  method to incorporate dispersive media previously
                  reported in the literature. Both Debye and Lorentz
                  dispersive media are considered. It is shown that,
                  for the former case, the stability limit of the
                  conventional FDTD method is preserved. However, for
                  the latter case, a more restrictive stability limit
                  is obtained. To overcome this drawback, a new scheme
                  is presented, which allows the stability limit of
                  the conventional FDTD method to be maintained},

abstract={A subcell model for thin wires in the finite-difference time-domain method using modified telegraphers equations has been developed by Holland et al. (1981). In this paper, we present an extension of their algorithm, which allows arbitrarily located and oriented wires with respect to the Cartesian grid. This is important to be able to accurately model wires that cannot be aligned to the Cartesian grid, e.g., tilted wires and circular loop wires. A symmetric coupling between field and wires yields a stable time-continuous field-wire system and the fully discrete field-wire system is stable under a Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) condition. The accuracy and excellent consistency of the proposed method are demonstrated for dipole and loop antennas with comparisons with the method of moments and experimental data.},

pages={1458 - 1466 },
abstract={A new oblique thin wire formalism based on Holland's approach is proposed in the FDTD method. The principal achievement of this new formalism is to enable us to model a junction correctly between several oblique wires. To this end, an important criterion is proposed: the continuity of the current traces in the grid must be maintained at each node of the Yee cell that contains a part of one or several wires. This condition prevents undamped parasite oscillations on the wire current responses. In addition, our approach offers versatility in its usage. First the extremities of the wire can be placed freely in a Yee cell. Second it operates in lossy medium and finally, the sensitivity of the wire is minimized when inclined or shifted. With regards to this last point, the in-cell inductance of a wire segment is formulated to take account of the segment position and its obliquity in the Yee cell.},

abstract={ A description of offset thin wires in numerical electromagnetic simulations is presented without incurring the use of excessive computational storage and simulation times. The description of such fine features has been a major difficulty due to the simultaneous existence of both small and large dimensions which exert constraints when trying to achieve the required accuracy. Alternative approaches have been proposed which utilise the appropriate modifications and interfaces of coarse numerical meshes to allow the incorporation of a fine feature within a cell. These, however, are mainly based on obtaining approximations for the in-cell inductance and capacitance of the wire which are then used to describe gross electromagnetic behaviour through interfacing to the field model. A hybrid method approach is presented in which an exact analytical description of the electromagnetic fields is first obtained and then modelled numerically. The offset capability is possible through the use of summation theorems which extend the method originally developed for centred thin wires. The alternative formulation is accurate, robust and has the advantage of being non-numerical method specific, although the transmission line modelling (TLM) method is used here for illustration. Significantly, no empirical factors are used as in some presently used methods.},

abstract={A numerical method is proposed to model transients in a shielded cable embedded in a three-dimensional field domain by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The coaxial shielded cable is assumed to be a multiconductor transmission line (MTL). The in cell voltage and the current on the external shield surface are calculated by a full-wave method, while the core current and the core-to-shield voltage are analyzed by assuming the validity of the quasi-TEM propagation mode inside the shield. The internal and external shield surfaces are coupled by the transfer admittance and by the transfer impedance of the cable shield. The solution is obtained by the FDTD method combining the MTL equations with the field equations. The proposed time-domain method takes into account the frequency-dependent parameters of the cable conductors by recursive convolution techniques. The validation of the procedure is performed in simple test configurations},

We provide a technique that automatically generates new FDTD update equations for small objects. Our presentation focusses on 2D-FDTD. We start from the FDTD equations in a fine grid where the time derivative is not discretised. This yields a large state-space model that is drastically reduced with a reduced order modeling technique. The reduced state-space model is then translated into new FDTD update equations that can be used in an FDTD simulation in the same way as the existing update equations for wires and thin slots. This technique is applied to a number of numerical problems showing the accuracy and versatility of the proposed method.},

abstract={Analysing microwave millimeter-wave integrated circuits (MMIC) with the FDTD technique can require a large computation space, and, as a consequence, a long computation time. With this technique, accurate frequency responses are obtained by the Fourier transform of very long time domain records. A classical way to lower the computation time is to apply linear, or non-linear, predictors, to short time domain records. We propose another method to lower the computation time: this method consists in reducing the computation space by introducing a formalism of a microstrip inside an elementary cell. We have applied the above formalism to the determination of the S21 parameter for the classical double-stub filter. For the computation, the filter is enclosed in a PEC parallelepipedic cavity. This formalism is similar to the thin wire formalism previously introduced by Holland and Simpson (1981)},
