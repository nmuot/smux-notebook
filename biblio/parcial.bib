abstract={cattering of electromagnetic fields from objects on or beneath the ground can be analyzed with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The equivalence principle can be utilized for generation of incident plane waves where the Fresnel reflection and refraction coefficients are multiplied by the pulse spectrum in the frequency domain and the result is transformed into The time-domain. Errors will appear in the Huygens' sources due to numerical dispersion where the main errors come from the use of analytical reflection and refraction coefficients. Their influence on the accuracy is generally negligible for applications where the scattered field from the object is greater than the numerical errors introduced. However, if weak scattering events are considered, such as for objects buried in the ground, the dispersion errors can be of the same order of magnitude as the scattered field. In this paper we derive the modified Fresnel coefficients for a homogeneous lossy ground which are consistent with the FDTD algorithm and can be used in the Huygens' sources for suppressing numerical errors. It is shown that the modified Fresnel coefficients reduces the noise level for an empty FDTD volume by 30 to 60 dB. As an application example, the far-zone scattering of a buried dipole is considered.},

abstract={An integral equation is developed for determining the time-dependent current distribution on a wire structure excited by an arbitrary time-varying electric field. The subsectional collocation form of the method of moments is used to reduce this integral equation to a form that can be evaluated on a digital computer as an initial value problem. A Lagrangian interpolation scheme is introduced so that the dependent variables can be accurately evaluated at any point in the spacetime cone; thus, only mild restrictions on the space and time sample density are required. The integral equation relating present values of the current to previously computed values is presented in a form that can be directly converted into a computer code. Expressions are developed for the computer time and the relative advantages of time-domain and frequency-domain calculations are discussed, providing impetus for analyses in the time domain in certain cases.},

It also gives guidance concerning the lightning hazard assessment requirements of STANAG 4327. The first part of this AOP describes the lightning discharge process together with the relevant properties of lightning, and relates them to the hazards experienced by weapon systems and munitions. It discusses the ways in which lightning may interact with weapon systems or munitions, the consequent effects and the various mechanisms by which damage may be inflicted. It also indicates how protection design and test parameters are derived from the physical properties of lightning. It should be read in conjunction with STANAG 4327 and STANAG 4236, 'Lightning environmental conditions affecting the design of material for use by the NATO Forces', which gives numerical values of the lightning parameters that are to be used in the design of munitions and weapon systems."

The lack of a natural boundary calls for an investigation of the appropriate boundary conditions. These are determined by a heuristic argument and are shown to be sufficient in a special case. Approximate conditions necessary to insure the mathematical stability of the difference equation are derived. The results of a series of four 24-hour forecasts computed from actual data at the 500 mb level are presented, together with an interpretation and analysis. An attempt is made to determine the causes of the forecast errors. These are ascribed partly to the use of too large a space increment and partly to the effects of baroclinicity. The rôle of the latter is investigated in some detail by means of a simple baroclinic model.DOI: 10.1111/j.2153-3490.1950.tb00336.x},
